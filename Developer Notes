rsync stdout can be hidden at boot by doing the following:

	Edit script
	After live boot installs (Just before 'echo -e "Packages installed successfully\n"' line), add:
		echo "Press Enter"
		read key
	Save and run script
	When script pauses, open different terminal and cd to /lib/live/boot
	Edit 9990-toram-todisk.sh 
	Comment out the 'echo " * Copying $MODULETORAMFILE to RAM" 1>/dev/console' line
	Change both 'rsync -a' lines to 'rsync -aq'
	Save file and continue script

	Note: 
	"expr: syntax error" and "sh: bad number" will likely still appear at boot. Still working on
	fixing those.
