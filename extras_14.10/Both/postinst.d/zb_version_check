#Description:
#	This script checks /lib/modules for the currently running system
#	(whether it be the Original OS or the RAM Session) and writes
#	down all the kernels that the current system supports. This is
#	required because the Original OS and the RAM Session will not
#	always be equally up to date, so grub can no longer assume that
#	the latest kernel found in /boot is supported by the running OS,
#	as it normally does

OUTPUT=''

#Clear the $OUTPUT file

#For ever folder under /lib/modules, write it down to $OUTPUT
for DIR in $(find /lib/modules -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d)

	basename $DIR | sudo tee -a $OUTPUT >/dev/null
