This folder contains scripts that need to run during upgrades (running of rupgrade)

This includes changes that are more complex than just a change to an
existing file in an existing directory. Ex:

	A script file name change
	A change to the main RAM_Booster script that changes anything significant

Any scripts here will:
	1. Be run EVERY TIME rupgrade runs
	2. Be automatically made executable using chmod
	3. If ANY script fails, rupgrade fails and bails out
	4. Only scripts with a .sh extension will be executed

This means that ALL scripts in this folder MUST check to see if the
changes they are going to be making have already been made, and if so,
do nothing (exit with error code 0)
