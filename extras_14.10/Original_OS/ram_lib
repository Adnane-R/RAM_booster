#	Any code that is either reusable, or long enough that it would
#	make the main RAM Booster install script hard to read has been
#	made into a function and moved here.
#	Note: The main RAM Booster install script is the only script
#	that uses this file

#Returns the exit code of the command so that it can easily be checked

	#	$@ - contains the command itself that this function is supposed to run
